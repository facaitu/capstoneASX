Uncompiled Android applications are stored as complete projects with all resources and build properties included. Projects must retain complete folder format and correct directory heirarchy. As such, the source code files themselves are near useless if stored independant of the project remainder. Thus, this repository contains backup archives of the complete Android Studio project, which can be restored and imported for future use. Hopefully, the compression (using the 7Zip format) will keep the project size below GitHub's maximum upload size-limit of 25MB. -Zac Williams
